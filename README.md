# Deep-Learning-By-Udacity

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188). It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics. 


## Table Of Contents

### Tutorials

### Introduction to Neural Networks

* [Introduction to Neural Networks](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/introduction_to_neural_networks): Learn how to implement gradient descent and apply it to predicting patterns in student admissions data.

* [Introduction to PyTorch](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/introduction_to_pytorch): Learn how to build neural networks in PyTorch and use pre-trained networks for state-of-the-art image classifiers.

### Convolutional Neural Networks

* [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/convolutional_neural_networks): Visualize the output of layers that make up a CNN. Learn how to define and train a CNN for classifying [MNIST data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), a handwritten digit database that is notorious in the fields of machine and deep lea

* [Transfer Learning](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/transfer-learning). In practice, most people don't train their own networks on huge datasets; they use **pre-trained** networks such as VGGnet. Here you'll use VGGnet to help classify images of flowers without training an end-to-end network from scratch.
