## Table Of Contents

### Tutorials

### Introduction to Neural Networks

* [Introduction to Neural Networks](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/introduction_to_neural_networks): Learn how to implement gradient descent and apply it to predicting patterns in student admissions data.

* [Sentiment Analysis with NumPy](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/sentiment-analysis-network): [Andrew Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/) leads you through building a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.

* [Introduction to PyTorch](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/introduction_to_pytorch): Learn how to build neural networks in PyTorch and use pre-trained networks for state-of-the-art image classifiers.

### Convolutional Neural Networks

* [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/convolutional_neural_networks): Visualize the output of layers that make up a CNN. Learn how to define and train a CNN for classifying [MNIST data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), a handwritten digit database that is notorious in the fields of machine and deep learning. Also, define and train a CNN for classifying images in the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

* [Transfer Learning](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/transfer_learning). In practice, most people don't train their own networks on huge datasets; they use **pre-trained** networks such as VGGnet. Here you'll use VGGnet to help classify images of flowers without training an end-to-end network from scratch.  

* [Weight Initialization](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/weight_initialization): Explore how initializing network weights affects performance.

* [Autoencoders](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/autoencoder): Build models for image compression and de-noising, using feedforward and convolutional networks in PyTorch.

* [Style Transfer](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/style_transfer): Extract style and content features from images, using a pre-trained network. Implement style transfer according to the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) by Gatys et. al. Define appropriate losses for iteratively creating a target, style-transferred image of your own design!


### Recurrent Neural Networks

* [Intro to Recurrent Networks (Time series & Character-level RNN)](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/recurrent_neural_networks): Recurrent neural networks are able to use information about the sequence of data, such as the sequence of characters in text; learn how to implement these in PyTorch for a variety of tasks.

* [Embeddings (Word2Vec)](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/word2vec_embeddings): Implement the Word2Vec model to find semantic representations of words for use in natural language processing.

* [Sentiment Analysis RNN](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/sentiment_analysis_rnn): Implement a recurrent neural network that can predict if the text of a moview review is positive or negative.

* [Attention](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/attention): Implement attention and apply it to annotation vectors.

### Generative Adversarial Networks

* [Generative Adversarial Network on MNIST](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/mnist_gan): Train a simple generative adversarial network on the MNIST dataset.

* [Batch Normalization](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/batch_nomarlization): Learn how to improve training rates and network stability with batch normalizations.

* [Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/deep_convolutional_gan): Implement a DCGAN to generate new images based on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.



### Keras
* [Keras Mini-Project](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Deep-Learning-By-Udacity/tree/master/keras/student_admissions_keras): Learn how to implement gradient descent and apply it to predicting patterns in student admissions data using Keras.
